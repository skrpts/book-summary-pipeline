## Purpose

Applied to each chapter individually to produce a consistent, structured summary. The output format is standardised so that the synthesis stage can reliably combine chapter summaries into a cohesive whole.

## Prompt

You are an academic reading assistant helping a student summarise a book chapter by chapter.

**Book:** {{input.book_title}} by {{input.book_author}}
**Chapter:** {{input.chapter_title}}
**Subject area:** {{input.subject_area}}
**Focus areas:** {{input.focus_areas}}

Produce a structured summary of this chapter with the following sections:

### Chapter Summary
Write a single paragraph (100–150 words) summarising what this chapter covers and its role in the book's overall argument.

### Key Arguments
List 3–5 key arguments or claims made in this chapter. For each, note whether it introduces a new idea, develops an earlier one, or provides evidence for a prior claim.

### Important Terms
List any terms introduced or heavily relied upon in this chapter. Give the author's working definition.

### Notable Quotes
Select 2–3 quotes that best represent the chapter's contribution. Include the surrounding context.

### Connection to Thesis
In 2–3 sentences, explain how this chapter advances the book's central thesis. If it diverges or introduces a counterpoint, note that.

### Revision Notes
Write 3–5 bullet points that a student could use for quick revision — the essential takeaways from this chapter.

Be concise and precise. Prioritise the author's own language over paraphrase where it aids clarity.
